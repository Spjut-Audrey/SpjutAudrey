   		  									Designing, defining, triggering CSS animations 
											
											
		  
		  -Animations let you change a style of an element gradually
		  -You can change these styles as many times as you want
		  -For CSS3 you need to specify keyframes for the animation
		  -CSS animations are easier to use than script animations
		  		1. Simple and easy for Author- don't necessarily have to know JavaScript 
				2. Animations will run smoothly even under moderate system load. 
				3. Animations let the browser control animation sequences thereby reducing update frequency
				
				
		 Animations
		 
		 	-Use the animation property and sub-properties 
				-webkit-animation or -moz-animation 
			-Lots of different sub-properties to customize animations with 
					-animation-delay
					-animation-direction
					-animation-duration
					-animation-iteration-count
					-animation-name
					-animation-play-state
					-animation-timing-function
					-animation-fill-mode
			-shorthand can be used
			 	- animation: 3s infinite alternate slidein;
			-Can set multiple animations in one perperty value
					-animation-name: fadeInOut, slidein;
					-animation-duration: 2s, 6s;
					-animation-iteration-count: 4, 1;
				-if only two durations/iterations for more than two names then values cycle.

		  
		  
		  @keyframes
		  		
				-binds an animation to specific element
