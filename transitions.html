            <h2>Defining</h2> 
            <p>In CSS3 you can use transitions to transition through different property values. Generally accepted through all browsers, although using -webkit and -moz is recommended.</p>
            
            <p>Hover this box to see transitions in action!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="designing">
            <h2>Designing</h2>
            <p>To create a CSS transition you need to include several different items. You'll need to create a css property (the one you'd like to change with the transistion) and you'll need to specify the duration of the transition. </p>
            
            <p>If you hover of this box it does something cool too!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="triggering">
            <h2>Triggering with Javascript</h2>
            <p>There are cool ways to use these transitions and trigger them using Javascript! Here is an example below.</p>

            <button id="btb" onclick="classChange()">Click here!</button>
            <p>You'll notice the button above, it calls a function using the onclick attribute to toggle from one CSS class and transition to another class.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="transitionBox" id="tranBox">
            <p>I am a box and I exist only to get used by Javascript and contain no important information about transitions.</p>
        </section>
        
        <script src="main.js"></script>
    </body>
